## Features

* **Inline confidence slider** – select any text, drag the slider in the Bubble Menu; weight & opacity update live.
* **Google-Docs-style page** – centred white sheet on a grey canvas.
* **Low-Confidence View** – toggle to focus on paragraphs < 50 % confidence.
* **HTML Export** – retains `data-confidence` attributes for downstream use.
* **Local-first** – document autosaves to `localStorage`; no backend required.

## How to use

1. Start typing on the page.
2. Highlight a word, sentence, or paragraph.
3. A Bubble Menu appears – drag the slider to the desired confidence %. The text immediately changes its "ink weight".
4. Use *Toggle Low Confidence View* (top-left buttons) to focus feedback.
5. Click *Export HTML* to download a standalone file for sharing.

Everything is stored in the browser; clearing site data resets the doc.

## Roadmap

- Adding multipe assumptions per confidence-leveled statement to see where the level of confidence comes from
