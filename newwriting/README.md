## Quick start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 18
* npm >= 9 (comes with Node)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/inkweight.git
cd inkweight
```

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è  Note**‚ÄÉThe actual app lives in the `newwriting` sub-folder (keeps the root free for docs & config).

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd newwriting          # jump into the app folder
npm install            # grab packages (~200 MB)
```

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev -- --host   # launches Vite; prints local & LAN URLs
```

Open the shown URL (default `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

### 4. Build for production (optional)

```bash
npm run build          # outputs to dist/
```

`npm run preview` serves the production build locally.

## How to use

1. Start typing on the page.
2. Highlight a word, sentence, or paragraph.
3. A Bubble Menu appears ‚Äì drag the slider to the desired confidence %. The text immediately changes its "ink weight".
4. Use *Toggle Low Confidence View* (top-left buttons) to focus feedback.
5. Click *Export HTML* to download a standalone file for sharing.

Everything is stored in the browser; clearing site data resets the doc.

## Roadmap

- Adding multipe assumptions per confidence-leveled statement to see where the level of confidence comes from
